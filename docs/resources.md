## ðŸ”µ Data ðŸ—º

You can use **what ever data you want.** But here are a few sources which could help you to get started or give you new ideas ðŸ‘‡

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
	- OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. If you seek for easy ways to get an extract of the data, you can check for [GeoFabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) for Shapefiles or [osmdata.xyz](https://download.osmdata.xyz/) for GeoPackages or [Overpass API for GeoJSONs etc.](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) .
- [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
	- Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.
- [Free GIS Data](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/)
	- The site contains a categorised list of links to over 500 sites providing freely available geographic datasets - all ready for loading into a Geographic Information System.
- [OS OpenData](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html)
	- Ordnance Survey Open Data for Great Britain. Includes general topographic map data at a range of scales; useful thematic data such as greenspace, terrain, roads and rivers; postcode and place name georeferencing.
- [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/)
	- Interesting datasets from around the world.
- [LINZ Data Service](https://data.linz.govt.nz/)
	- New Zealand land and sea data available for free under a Creative Commons licence via download or OGC APIs.
- [LINZ NZ Aerial Basemap](https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz/)
	- Current aerial imagery for New Zealand available under a Creative Commons licence via WMTS or XYZ tile services.
- [Open Topography](https://opentopography.org/)
	- Lidar point cloud and DEM data.
- [A collective list of free APIs for use in software and web development.](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- [GIS data repositories spreadsheet by Karen Payne](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utQRlrX3lJniBjWE3rNjLZeTRsbjH-zdjxNmXhhvO9Q/edit#gid=47)

## ðŸ”µ Tools ðŸ”¨ðŸ”§

Because the challenge is aimed to be open for everyone, the tools listed here will be *open source tools*. Still, **the challenge can be done with any kind of software** (or even without any software). Programming skills are a requirement to do the maps.

 - [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
	 - A Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. A desktop software that allows you to read/write multiple data formats and output (mainly static) maps.
 - [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/)
	 - Open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets and for interactive maps.
 - [Aerialod](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod)
	 - Not really a GIS tool, but can be used to create some stunning 3D visualizations
 - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
	 - Free and open source 3D creation suite. Check out the BlenderGIS extension.
 - [R packages for geospatial](https://www.r-project.org/)
	 - [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html), [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) and [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) to mention few examples.
 - [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org)
	 - Useful for geospatial data processing in the browser such as file format conversion, map projection, feature simplification, filtering, clipping, merging etc. Can also be run [locally from the command line](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper).
 - [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
	 - Declarative visualization specification including [cartographic output](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/#maps-geographic-displays). Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such as [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) (Python) and [elm-vegalite](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vegalite/latest/VegaLite) (Elm). See, for example, this tutorial on using [OpenStreetMap with elm-vegalite](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis/blob/master/documents/tutorials/geoTutorials/openstreetmap.md)
 - [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
	 - More flexible but lower-level declarative visualization specification including cartographic output. Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such [elm-vega](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/latest/).
 - [Litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis)
	 - Literate Visualization notebook environment optimised for specifying visualizations and documenting the design process. While not specific to cartography, can be a useful environment for exploring cartographic design.
 - [Observable](https://observablehq.com)
	 - Reactive notebook environment for generation of visualization and cartographic output embedded in a textual narrative. Focus is on using [d3](https://d3js.org) for specifying visual output.
